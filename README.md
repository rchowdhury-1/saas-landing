SaaS Landing Page (React + Vite)
Built a responsive SaaS marketing site using React (Vite), with reusable components for header, hero, features, pricing, and footer. Implemented data-driven UI using props and .map() for feature and pricing lists, and styled the layout with mobile-first CSS and basic grid/flexbox. Deployed via Netlify and managed with Git/GitHub.
